Situation: 
Your PC is connected to your router (with access to the Internet) via WIFI.
And you realize that your PC doesn't have SSH access to your server on the Internet. 
Please describe all steps for troubleshooting this issue in the order of your checking.
And this list of steps as plain text in a new file and push it to your github repository.

1) We should check whether server is up:
	a) Standard option is to send ICMP packet using ping command.
	b) If server doesn't receive ICMP packet then we can test open ports using telnet utility.
2) Checking SSH credentials
3) Best option is to authenticate with keys (if server is accessible)
	a) Generate ssh keys: ssh-keygen
	b) Copy generated ssh public key to remote server: ssh-copy-id user@remotehost
	c) Doing above steps "ssh user@remotehost" will give remote shell
4) Contacting to server administrator
